# peach-ditto
This is an ongoing project to clone the peach.cool android app, which is
excellent, go download it.

The android peach app is a great example of an app that uses standard
material design practices as well as incorporates unique UI elements.

I'm building this app to familiarize myself more with various material
view components, test out some MVP design practices, and try my hand at
some networking API design.

MVP design is roughly based on @rallat's EffectiveAndroid:

Peach.cool does not have a public SDK, however, some passionate
engineers have exposed portions of the REST api. I leverage the work
done by @ummjackson here:

This isn't really meant to be a public demonstration, but I was
interested in sharing it with a few people and also interested in not
paying for a private repo.

Love you github,

xoxo jeran
